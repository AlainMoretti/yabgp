YABGP Project
=============

YABGP is a yet another Python implementation for BGP Protocol. It was born in
Cisco around 2011, we use it to establish BGP connections with all kinds
of routers (include real Cisco/HuaWei/Juniper routers and some router
simulators in Cisco like IOL/IOU) and receive/parse BGP messages for
future analysis. Now we open sourced it.

We write it in strict accordance with the specifications of RFCs.

This software can be used on Linux/Unix, Mac OS and Windows systems.
