# openbgp

### What is openbgp?

OpenBGP is a Python implementation for BGP Protocol. It was born in Cisco around 2011, we use it to establish BGP connections with all kinds of
routers (include real Cisco/HuaWei/Juniper routers and some router simulators in Cisco like IOL/IOU) and receive/parse BGP messages for future analysis.

We write it in strict accordance with the specifications of RFCs.
